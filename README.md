# Swarm-Intelligence-in-Autonomous-Agents-for-Search-and-Rescue-Operations
## Overview

This project simulates multi-agent search and rescue in a 2D environment using two swarm intelligence techniques:

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) – Agents move based on inertia, personal best, and social influence.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) – Agents (ants) explore using pheromone trails and probabilistic path selection.

The simulation is built with Python, Pygame for visualization, and Matplotlib for performance analysis.

Features

✅ Swarm-based search for targets in obstacle-rich environments
✅ Two algorithms implemented for comparison:

PSO (velocity-based continuous movement)

ACO (pheromone-based grid exploration)

✅ Real-time visualization using Pygame

✅ Performance metrics:

Time to find all targets

Distance traveled

Exploration coverage

Idle time

Collision count

✅ Automated testing with multiple runs and CSV export
✅ Normalized performance plots for comparative analysis


## Future Work

Implement hybrid PSO-ACO approach

Introduce dynamic obstacles

Support for 3D environments

Real-world robotic swarm adaptation
